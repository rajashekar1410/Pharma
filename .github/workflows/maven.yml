    ### Run Fortify ScanCentral Client ###
    # Update BUILD_OPTS based on the ScanCentral Client documentation and your project's included tech stack(s).
    #   ScanCentral Client will download dependencies for maven, gradle and msbuild projects.
    #   For other build tools, add your build commands to the workflow to download necessary dependencies and prepare according to Fortify SCA documentation.
