# IWA (Insecure Web App)

## Overview

_IWA (Insecure Web App)_ is an example Java/Spring Web Application for use in **DevSecOps** scenarios and demonstrations.
The source code includes some examples of insecure code - which can be found using static and dynamic application 
security testing tools such as [Fortify SCA](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/static-code-analysis-sas), 
[Fortify On Demand](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/application-security-testing)
and [Fortify WebInspect](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/webinspect-dynamic-analysis-dast).

One of the main aims of this project is to illustrate how security can be embedded early and continuously in
the development lifecycle - so a number of "integrations" to common build and pipeline tools is provided. 

Please note: the application should not be used in a live or production environment!
